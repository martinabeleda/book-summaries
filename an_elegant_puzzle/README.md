## Organizations

### Staying on the path to high-performing teams

**A team is falling behind if** each week, their backlog is longer that it was the week before. People are working hard but making
little progress, morale is low or users are dissatisfied

**A team is treading water if** they're able to get critical work done but aren't able to pay down technical debt or begin major
new projects.

**A team is repaying debt when** they're able to start repaying debt and benefiting from this snowballing effect.

**A team is innovating when** their technical debt is sustainably low, morale is high and the majority of work is satisfying user
needs.

### System fixes and tactical support

**When a team is falling behind** hire more people until the team moves to treading water. Set user expectations. Find easy wins.

**When the team is treading water** consolidate efforts to finish more things and to reduce the concurrent work until they're able to
begin repaying debt. Transition from personal -> team view of productivity.

**When a team is repaying debt** Add time to allow the space for the compounding effect of paying debt to grow. Manage expectations from
users or stakeholders who are antsy for the team to start delivering new stuff.

**Innovating** is a bit different. Maintain slack in the team's schedule so they can build quality into their work and continuously
innovate. The quickest path out of innovation is to be viewed as a team that builds science projects.

## Tools

### Product Management

It's common for product management and engineering to be split up into separate roles. This isn't always ideal since these roles benefit
both from distinct skills and different perspectives. While product management is a deep profession in it's own right, it's a pretty critical
skill for any engineering leader.

**Product Management:** An iterative elimination tournament of problem discovery, problem selection and solution validation.

#### Problem discovery

Explore the different problems that you could choose to solve. Some themes are:

1. Users' pain. Could go broad through survey mechanisms or deep through interviews
1. Users' purpose. What motivates your users to use your systems. How can you go furthere to accomplish these goals?
1. Benchmark. Look at competitors. Where are the weaknesses. The best approach is to consider both very similar and very different companies.
1. Cohorts. Explore hidden data inside cohorts of users. Can help discovery new kinds of users with different needs.
1. Competitive advantage. Identify where you're strong. Can help identify opportunities you are best placed to fill.
1. Comptitive moats. More extreme version of the above. Makes it possible to explore avenues that others can't.
1. Compounding leverage. What composable blocks could you build today that could compound into major product or tech leverage over time?

#### Problem selection

Filtering down the different problems into a portfolio or roadmap.

1. Thresholds. What are the minimum thresholds for a solution? E.g. revenue targets, levels of adoption etc.
1. Consider different time frames. What would you do if your company was going to run out of money in 6 months? What if there were no external
factors requiring results in 2 to 5 years?
1. Return on investment. People often underestimate quick, easy wins.
1. Industry trends. What work will position you best for where the industry is going?

#### Solution validation

It is important to think about how you define success up front.

1. Write a customer letter. What would the launch announcement look like. What would users respond to it?
1. Identify prior art. How to peers approach this problem? Rely on network here.
1. Find reference users. Can you find users willing to be early adopters. If you can't, that's not a good sign.
1. Prefer experimentation over analysis. Allows you to find problems you didn't anticipate.
1. Find the path more quickly traveled. What is the cheapest path to de-risking the solution? Can you build an MVP or a spike?
1. Justify switching costs. Test with users if the benefit provided by the solution is worth the switching costs.
